# WhatStats
WhatStats is a web app to compute various statistics for Whatsapp group chats including number of posts and number of words.

Whatsapp does not have an API, so chat statistics must be computed via upload of txt file exported from the Whatsapp
app for iOS or Android.

WhatStats is developed using Python Flask and Jinja and deployed through Heroku.
